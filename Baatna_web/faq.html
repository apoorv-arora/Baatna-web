You can post your need and borrow any consumer good such as - travel bag, gym equipment or juice maker etc. on the application. We will broadcast your needs to people in your neighborhood, your friends and other people in your community who can help you, you can then interact using our app and fulfill your need.<br><br>

                            As you post your need on our app, it gets broadcasted as a push notification/email/sms on the mobile phones of all other relevant users in your community. Now, any member of your community who possesses the thing you need and is willing to share it with you can accept your request and you guys can then have a conversation via our app. Although we urge people to personally meet to pick up and drop things by themselves, we also provide on demand logistics facility.<br><br>

                                    We make sure that your needs get fulfilled in the following way-
                                    <ul>
                                         <li>As you post your need it gets broadcasted to people near you in your community.</li>
                                         <li>Our algorithms make sure that your need also gets broadcasted to people in your Facebook friend list and your phone contact list in the right chronological order.</li>
                                         <li>If still unfulfilled, our operations team will make sure that they notify people who have previously fulfilled similar needs.</li>

                            <h4 class=" text-left">4.   Why would someone lend out their things for free?</h4>
                            <h3 class="caption1 text-left">People like offering help, from the goodness of their own heart (not because they are forced to). Baatna offers them an opportunity to do so, it helps people feel good about themselves, to feel happy that they helped someone. And this direct personal incentive directly contributes to these more abstract personal beliefs of creating a community and reducing waste. 
                            <br>On Baatna, you are asking known people inside your community for help. People are much more reluctant to ask a particular person for help (as required in the inventory based model), than asking for help in general (shouting out the request at Baatna).

                            <br>The inventory model requires a user to reveal all items she/he is willing to lend to potential borrowers. This may lead to awkward situations wherein a lender might like to deny a request for a certain item from a particular borrower. People hate to say no, and therefore they may not put up a lot of things on display in their inventory. In Baatna, on the other hand, you may decide to lend something in response to particular request. You never have to say no, you just choose each and every time to say yes (or say nothing).

                            <br><br>

                            <h4 class=" text-left">5.   Why should I post my need on Baatna and not browse through Internet for it?</h4>
                            <h3 class="caption1 text-left">You don’t have to buy things in order to have access to them. No one uses an electric drill all the time, but buy one just for the occasional need at home. By borrowing rather than buying, you save money, and prevent yourself from becoming overburdened with stuff.

                            <br>You get to meet people in your neighborhood. Remember the age old pretext of “borrowing a cup of sugar” in order to chat up that hot girl on the floor below? Well, Baatna allows you a whole bunch of new people to meet through borrowing something. Given that they own a specific item that you need, there’s a decent chance that you have some interest in common.

                            <br>You are also doing good for the environment. By borrowing and lending things, fewer items are needed in a neighborhood. This prevents waste and the use of our planet’s valuable resources in producing things.<br><br>

                                    <li>In case you feel the thing you are lending out is too valuable, you can ask the borrower to setup a security amount with us which will be 100% refundable upon timely return.</li>
