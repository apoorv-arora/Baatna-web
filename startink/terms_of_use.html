  <h1>	Terms of Use	<h1>
  <h4><p>Your goals, accomplishments and most of all, your dreams are highly important to us. This may make you feel overwhelmed but all INKs, photos and content that you aspire and have already achieved belong to you only, because we understand the value of your INKs and goals.<br>

We believe that life starts with learning and continues with it, so we will give you extra features/privileges/credits if you offer us your valuable suggestions or feedback in any form. You can mail such suggestions to support@startink.com<br><br>

Safety has quite a boring definition but what we can promise you is we will try our best to keep this world of dreams safe. Your INKs are a significant and powerful entity of this world and hence we request your help in ensuring its safety by making a pact:</p>

1.You are free to share dreams and INKs with fellow users but you will not collect users' content or information using malicious tools (like implementing bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) or any automated means. <br>

2.You will not bully or harass any user in any form, even if he/she is a dumbass.<br>

3.Any content based hate speech (esp. involving corrupt politicians), religious discussions, pornography or nudity should be avoided and limited to your rooms/dorm or your media player.<br>

4.You will not use STARTink to do anything unlawful even if you live in a country where you rule.<br>

5.On a serious note, you should not attempt anything that may disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of STARTink, such as a denial of service attack.</h4><br><br>
