  <h2 >Planning and Achieving Goals</h2>
 <br />
 
    <p>What an extraordinary time we are living in with the economy and technology exploding on a daily basis. It is something we all should be taking advantage of in the years ahead. 
		Sometimes we just don't know how to get going in the right direction.
	</p>
   <p>If we can give you valuable information that will help you achieve your dreams and ambitions, then we are helping both of us succeed.
   	 What we will ask of you is to map out a plan for yourself, make some new commitments, take a little time and INK your, career / business, and financial goals just to name a few.
   </p>

   <p>Don't overwhelm yourself trying to conquer everything at once.
   	 We tend to bite off more than we can chew, that is why it is important to start with just a few goals, achieve them and then move on to the next set.
   	 But one important thing to remember about the whole planning procedure is that it will always be a work in process that changes along the way.
   	 We need to be flexible, but try and stick to the desired end results as much as possible.
   	</p>
 		 We are bombarded everyday to have and achieve goals, so why are goals so important to have, analyzed and take note of?
  <p>First of all, GOALS WILL HELP YOU ACCOMPLISH MORE AND GET FURTHER AHEAD IN ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE THAN WITHOUT PLANNING THEM..
  	 If you do not put forth the effort to set goals, your accomplishments will certainly be less than what you are capable of living up to.
  	 Statistics have shown 70% of the population do not set or write down their goals.
  	 Don't let yourself fall into this statistic.
  	 We all have an inner drive which constantly propels us to realize our dreams, so take the time to make the most of yourself.</p>

  <p>Second, throughout our lives we are constantly evaluating performances and accomplishments. Statistics predominate us every day.
  	 What you have completed, learned, put to the test of cognizance.
  	 We measure progresses every day.
  	 We are evaluating how much will be my GPA, which industries can I join or what courses should I take for the next semester.
	 You fit in there somewhere. You should be the first to know exactly where you stand. Be your own best asset.
	</p>
  <p>Third, on a regular basis we get interviewed about our standards and performances, whether at our home by our parents or by our friends or professors.
  	 Knowing your goals is so important when interviewing.
  	 You need to know what your accomplishments and successes are so you can promote yourself when the time is right.
  	 Hiring authorities recognize and want someone who has the forethought to put ideas and plans together.</p>
	 
	 The question may not come in the form of where do you see yourself in two years, but could be as simple as the last accomplishment you were proud of and how did you achieve it. The goals you make and want to obtain should roll off of your tongue, succinctly and with a firm commitment that you truly mean what you are saying. Give your goals life.
